# Dinamik Management Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 30, 2025_

Dinamik Management ("the App") is a personal property-management tool maintained by Kimani James. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and the choices available to you. The App is distributed via the Apple App Store for use on iOS devices.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Account & Sync Data**: The App uses your Apple ID with iCloud to sync data across your devices. We store app-specific identifiers necessary for synchronization.
- **Property & Tenant Records**: You may enter names, contact information, lease details, rent amounts, utilities, documents, photos, and notes to manage your properties. This data remains in your private iCloud container (`iCloud.com.kimanijames.DinamikManagement`).
- **Location Data**: If you enable location-based reminders, the App accesses your location to trigger geofenced alerts. Location usage is optional and can be disabled at any time in iOS Settings.
- **Camera & Photo Library**: When you choose to capture or import ID documents or property photos, the App requests access to your camera or photo library.
- **Calendar & Contacts**: If you opt in, the App may write events to your calendar or create contact cards for tenants. These integrations are optional and controlled through system prompts.

## 2. How We Use Information

- Provide core property-management functionality (records, reminders, scheduling, payments tracking).
- Sync your data securely across your devices via iCloud.
- Send local and push notifications for reminders you configure (rent due, maintenance tasks, showings).
- Generate reports and financial summaries for your personal bookkeeping.

We do **not** sell your data, show ads, or share your information with third parties.

## 3. Data Storage & Security

- All user data is stored locally on your devices and in your private iCloud container. Only you (through your Apple ID) can access this data.
- The developer does not maintain separate servers; Apple's iCloud security controls and your device security (Face ID, Touch ID, passcode) protect your information.

## 4. Notifications & Background Activity

- Notifications are used solely to deliver reminders you schedule.
- Background location updates are used only to power geofenced reminders (e.g., property visit checklists).
- You can manage notification and location permissions anytime in iOS Settings > Privacy & Security.

## 5. Your Choices

- **Opt Out of Location**: Disable location permissions to stop geofenced reminders.
- **Notification Preferences**: Adjust notification settings per property, disable specific reminder categories, or revoke notification permission entirely.
- **Data Editing & Deletion**: You can update or delete any property, tenant, document, or payment record within the App. Removing the App or disabling iCloud Drive will delete your synced data.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App is intended for property owners and managers. It is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy when new features require additional disclosures. The "Last updated" date will change, and release notes will summarize material updates.
